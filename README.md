**Status:** Work in Progress *(alpha/beta coming soon)*

## Overview

This selfbot uses various well-known selfbots leaked & open source code including components reverse-engineered from *nighty* and others.  
I’ll be integrating new, original features and taking community suggestions as development progresses.
